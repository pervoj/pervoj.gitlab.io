	<article><h2 id="2014-and-2015">2014 and 2015</h2>
<p>My dad is programmer and I alway wanted to be one too. But I wasn't patient. I wanted to be a programmer right away without any work. In 2014 I started learning Java from the Czech website called ITnetwork.cz. As I said, I wasn't patient. Everything I did was copying a code snipets from the courses and trying to compile successfully without thinkig or reading the texts. As I'm sure you can guess, it didn't really work. This way I finished the course. Of course, after reading the whole course, I didn't know anything at all.</p>
<p>But the year 2015 chanded everything. I got a book about Scratch for my 9th birthday and I was very interested in it. I was programming in Scratch almost every day. I didn't stop until a year and a half later, when I started studying for the high school entrance exam. Then in high school I didn't do programming for a long time. I was just learning HTML and CSS.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-year-2020">The big year 2020</h2>
<p>The year 2020 was amazing. A lot happened in this pandemic-tainted year. At the beginning of this year I didn't go to school due to illness and I was bored. So I thought I might give programming a second chance and I started learning Java again. I read all the lessons carefully and everything miraculously worked. I was really happy and it motivated me so much that I learned a lot of things in that year and even switched to Linux.</p>
<p>In the spring, when I was reading something on the internet, I read about Linux. Dad told me more about it <em>(he is still on Windows, but he use Linux server at the work)</em> and I was really excited. I started looking for materials and figuring out how to install Linux Mint.</p>
<p>In September I was done and I decided to delete Windows and go to Mint. I lasted almost a year with Mint, in May 2021 I switched to Fedora. But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
<h2 id="another-nice-year-2021">Another nice year 2021</h2>
<p>Over time, I became interested in the GTK apps and I wanted to know how are they made. Because the only language I knew was Java, I was looking for how to use GTK with Java. But I came across something more interesting, Vala language.</p>
<p>Vala had a similar syntax to Java, so I started learning it. Gradually, I started to get into it. I started to love GTK. I even decided to switch to GNOME because of GTK.</p>
<p>I didn't want Ubuntu besause of its modifications. I wanted pure GNOME. I was familiar with APT, so I was searching for some Debian based distro with GNOME and I found Pop!_OS. Unfortunately, before I could switch to Pop!_OS, they announced that they will now use their own DE called Cosmic instead of GNOME.</p>
<p>So in May I decided to switch to Fedora. It wasn't based on APT, but I figured I'd at least learn something new. I also started learning JavaScript and Python on Fedora.</p>
<h2 id="beginning-of-2022">Beginning of 2022</h2>
<p>At the end of January I decided to switch to Arch Linux. I became interested in the rolling release and do-it-yourself system.</p>
<p>So this post I am writing from Arch Linux with GNOME 41.</p>
<h2 id="edit-march-23-2022-switching-back-to-fedora"><em>[Edit March 23, 2022] switching back to Fedora</em></h2>
<p>After the new GNOME release I really wanted to try it. So I took advantage of being on a rolling release distribution and I updated my system right away. After the update I restarted my computer, but it didn't boot up again.</p>
<p>I knew that this can happen with Arch Linux and that there are tutorials on how to fix it. But I decided to come back from Arch to Fedora. The system do-it-yourself, which I liked before, gradually became quite annoying.</p>
<p>So I would update the last paragraph from the last chapter:</p>
<p>This post I am updating from Fedora 36 with GNOME 42. üôÇÔ∏è</p>
